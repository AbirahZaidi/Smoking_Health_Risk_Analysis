# 🚬 Smoking Health Risk Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes the **health risks associated with smoking**.
It highlights how smoking status impacts **different organs, age groups and health conditions** such as cholesterol and hypertension.

The dashboard allows users to **compare Healthy vs Damaged conditions** and observe changes across multiple health indicators.

## 📊 Key Objectives

* Analyze smoking patterns across different age groups
* Compare **Never, Current and Former smokers**
* Visualize health risks related to:

  * Heart
  * Lungs
